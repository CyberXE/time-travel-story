Wang is a girl in Taiwan. She is working in a IT company.
She was a normal girl all her life, up until her company offered her overtime pay to become an "experiment assistant".  Now Wang didn't know what this would entail at the time, but she showed up for her first day on the job, and was immediately shocked to find their company had been working on a time travel machine the whole time!
Wang was intrigued. She'd always wondered ho the world would end up in the future. She grew restless day by day and finally she decided that she wanted to travel into the future. And, so she soon found herself in the year 3050. However, upon reaching the future she was shocked. Wang ended up in an alien-like version of society today. The people of the world found themselves wiped out in the face of an unforseen pandemic coined "Heinekenvirus". Their numbers diwndled to some 50,000. Many animals Wang used to see in her everyday life had suddenly disappeared. The landscape had been burnt to a crsip, she learned, after the intruding alien race arrived. Only a few trees were in sight, leading Wang to believe that these aliens did not rely on oxygen to be able to breath.
After taking a few pictures of the world in 3050, Wang decided to travel back to the present, reporting her successful time travel to her company.
