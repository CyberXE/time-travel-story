Wang is a girl in Taiwan. She is working in a IT company.
She was a normal girl all her life, up until her company offered her overtime pay to become an "experiment assistant".  Now Wang didn't know what this would entail at the time, but she showed up for her first day on the job, and was immediately shocked to find their company had been working on a time travel machine the whole time!
